# Analyzing Business Data with T-SQL

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Analyzing Business Data with T-SQL](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/analyzing-business-data-with-tsql/).

## Running the Code

All scripts are in the `Scripts` folder and can be run from SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or whatever your SQL Server query runner of choice.

In order to run this code, you will need the [WideWorldImporters database](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0).  Ideally, you will run it on SQL Server 2022, as there are certain functions which become available in that version of SQL Server.
